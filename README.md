WARNING! 
A major change was made because of the growing code base that will require fixing almost every file. The folder structure is now changed. All former functions that were tied to the program have been moved to the /analysis/ folder.
this breaks stuff because many of the functions that were metrics are no longer going to be accessable to the functions in the /analysis folder until their locations are updated in the files. 

Welcome to Tensor_toolkit, a series of functions designed to study quantum physics using Tensorflow to optimize them when able. These functions are slowly coming together in a unified program. 
Feel free to use these functions in your own project, all we ask is that you attribute them to our project.

As this project fleshes out we have had to make a major change to our folder layout. We still need a solver, units, and a visualizer. If you have any insight or free time please help us get this thing working.
