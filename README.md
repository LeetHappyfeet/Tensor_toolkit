# Tensor Toolkit

Tensor Toolkit is a collection of Python tools and utilities for working with tensors in computational physics and general relativity simulations.
This toolkit provides a set of functions to manipulate tensors, compute stress-energy tensors,
generate vector fields, and perform other common operations used in tensor analysis.

## Installation

To use Tensor Toolkit, simply clone this repository to your local machine:


## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- TensorFlow (for certain modules)
- NumPy

Install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

The toolkit consists of several Python modules located in the `solver` and `analysis` directories. Each module contains functions related to a specific aspect of tensor analysis.

To use a specific function, import it into your Python script:

```python
from solver.getEnergyTensor import getEnergyTensor

# Use the getEnergyTensor function
```

Ensure that you have the necessary input data structures (e.g., metric tensors) before using the functions.

## Modules

- **solver**: Contains functions for computing stress-energy tensors, metric transformations, and related calculations.
- **analysis**: Contains utilities for generating vector fields, performing tensor transformations, and other analysis tasks.

## Examples

The `examples` directory contains sample scripts demonstrating how to use various functions and modules within Tensor Toolkit. You can refer to these examples to understand how to integrate the toolkit into your own projects.
