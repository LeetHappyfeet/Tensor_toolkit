In this Python version, I've converted the plotTensor function to a Python function plot_tensor, along with supporting functions like verify_tensor, 
label_cartesian_axis, get_slice_data, and plot_component.

The plotTensor function is designed to plot the unique elements of a tensor based on the slice plane specified by the user. 

    Inputs:
        tensor: The tensor struct object representing either a metric or stress-energy tensor.
        alpha: Alpha value of the surface grid display, ranging from 0 to 1.
        slicedPlanes: Coordinates that are sliced, represented by index values from 1 to 4.
        sliceLocations: Location of the slice in the specified coordinates.
Plot3+1.py accepts similar input arguments, verifies the metric tensor, decomposes it, and then plots the 3+1 elements based on the specified slice plane.

getSliceData
This Python function accepts the slice plane coordinates, slice center coordinates, and the tensor object as input arguments. 
It then returns the slice data indices based on the specified plane and center.

labelCartesianAxis: Accepts the slice plane coordinates as input and returns the labels for the x-axis and y-axis based on the specified plane.

plotComponent:
This Python function takes the tensor array component, title, x-axis label, y-axis label, and alpha value as input parameters and plots the component as a surface plot. 
It also defines a custom colormap function redblue that you can customize further based on your requirements.

plotq:
The plotq function takes a variable number of arguments, where the first argument is the array to be squeezed, and the rest are optional arguments for the plot function. 
If the length of the input arrays is greater than 3, it plots the squeezed arrays. Otherwise, it plots the input arrays directly. 
The squeeze function squeezes the input array using NumPy's squeeze function.

redblue:
Generates a red-blue color map based on the input values and returns a NumPy array representing the colormap.

surfq:
creates a surface plot of the squeezed array. If the input consists of three arrays, it plots the surface with the specified arrays and uses the redblue colormap based on the squeezed third array. 
Otherwise, it plots the surface with the squeezed first array and applies the redblue colormap based on that array.
