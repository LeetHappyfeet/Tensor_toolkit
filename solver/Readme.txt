Let's break down the mathematical concepts behind this program:

1. **Metric Tensor (g)**:
   - In general relativity, the metric tensor \( g \) describes the geometry of spacetime.
   - It characterizes distances and angles between events in spacetime.
   - The metric tensor is a symmetric tensor of rank 2, meaning it has 16 independent components (in 4-dimensional spacetime).

2. **Inverse Metric Tensor (g^-1)**:
   - The inverse metric tensor \( g^{-1} \) is used to raise and lower indices in tensor equations.
   - It's the inverse of the metric tensor, such that \( g \cdot g^{-1} = I \), where \( I \) is the identity tensor.
   - The inverse metric tensor allows us to convert between covariant and contravariant indices.

3. **Ricci Tensor (Ric)**:
   - The Ricci tensor \( \text{Ric} \) is a contraction of the Riemann curvature tensor.
   - It characterizes the curvature of spacetime in a way that's simpler than the full Riemann tensor.
   - The Ricci tensor encodes gravitational effects due to the presence of matter and energy.

4. **Ricci Scalar (R)**:
   - The Ricci scalar \( R \) is a contraction of the Ricci tensor.
   - It provides a scalar measure of the curvature of spacetime at a given point.
   - The Ricci scalar is important in Einstein's field equations, which relate the curvature of spacetime to the distribution of matter and energy.

5. **Einstein Tensor (G)**:
   - The Einstein tensor \( G \) is a tensor derived from the Ricci tensor and scalar.
   - It encodes the gravitational effects of matter and energy distribution in spacetime.
   - The Einstein tensor appears in Einstein's field equations, which describe the relationship between the curvature of spacetime and the distribution of matter and energy.

6. **Stress-Energy Tensor (T)**:
   - The stress-energy tensor \( T \) describes the distribution of energy, momentum, and stress in spacetime.
   - It's a source term in Einstein's field equations, representing the matter and energy content of the universe.
   - The stress-energy tensor relates the curvature of spacetime to the presence of matter and energy, governing the dynamics of gravitational interactions.
