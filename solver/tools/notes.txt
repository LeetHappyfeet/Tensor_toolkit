A few quick notes on this code. the variables gu, gl,R_munu, and gu are not correctly defined. They are placeholder values that will need some sort of separate math to work. They will probably become their own variables.

In this Python version:

    We precalculate the metric derivatives for improved performance.
    We construct the Ricci tensor using nested loops and preallocated arrays.
    The result is returned as the Ricci tensor.

Make sure to replace gu, gl, and delta with appropriate values when using the function. Also, ensure that all components of the tensor arrays have the same shape.
